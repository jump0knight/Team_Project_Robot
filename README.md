Robot Dog Project
Welcome to the Robot Dog project! This repository contains the design files and documentation for our ongoing team project, where we are creating a 3D-printed robot dog, integrating various components for functionality such as sensors, motors, and body connection.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design and build a robot dog capable of performing a range of tasks. Our team is working on several modules, including the body structure, leg connections, servo motor controls, and sensor integrations.

Team Contributions
Hasinu Ravishka
Designed the lower leg components and servo motor mechanism, ensuring precise movement control for the robot's locomotion.
Contributed critical mechanical designs for the leg system, optimizing for both functionality and stability.
YanSheng Zhao
Designed and sent the Shoulder 3D Print.
Created and shared the Wing 3D Print, which plays a key role in providing the robot's stability and movement.
Vladimir Galichyan
Designed and shared the Top Mount for Body Robot Dog Body-Sensor Connection (STL files).
Contributed to the overall body and sensor plots design, ensuring proper alignment for seamless connections between components.
MingYu Xia
Designed the Leg-Connect (now renamed to Robot-Dog-Connection), facilitating the connection between the leg components and the robot's body.
Contributed to the renaming of the leg connection part for clarity and consistency.
3D Models and Design Files
Here, you will find various STL files for the robot's parts, designed for 3D printing:

Top Mount (Body-Sensor Connection) - Essential for connecting the body and sensor components.
Shoulder 3D Print - Part of the robotâ€™s limb system, enabling movement and articulation.
Wing 3D Print - Helps with robot stability and overall movement control.
Lower Leg Design - Includes 3D printed parts for the lower leg, as well as servo motor placement.
Robot-Dog-Connection - The connection mechanism between the robot's legs and body.
How to Use
Requirements:
3D printer capable of printing the provided STL files.
A servo motor for controlling movement.
Compatible sensor for integration with the robot's body.
Steps:
Download the required STL files from this repository.
Use a 3D printer to print the parts.
Assemble the robot following the provided designs and instructions for each module.
Integrate the motors and sensors as needed to bring the robot to life.
