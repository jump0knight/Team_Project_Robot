# Robot Dog Project

Welcome to the **Robot Dog** project! This repository contains the design files and documentation for our ongoing team project, where we are creating a 3D-printed robot dog. We are integrating various components for functionality, such as sensors, motors, and body connections.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and build a **robot dog** capable of performing a range of tasks. Our team is working on several modules, including:

- **Body Structure**
- **Leg Connections**
- **Servo Motor Controls**
- **Sensor Integrations**

## Team Contributions

### Hasinu Ravishka
- Designed the **lower leg components** and integrated **servo motor mechanisms**, ensuring precise control over the robot's locomotion.
- Delivered key **mechanical designs** for the leg system, optimizing both **functionality** and **stability**.

### YanSheng Zhao
- Designed and sent the **Shoulder 3D Print**.
- Created and shared the **Wing 3D Print**, which plays a key role in enhancing the robot's **stability** and **movement**.

### Vladimir Galichyan
- Designed and shared the **Top Mount for Body-Sensor Connection** (STL files).
- Contributed to the overall **body** and **sensor** plots design, ensuring proper alignment for seamless connections between components.

### MingYu Xia
- Designed the **Leg-Connect** (now renamed to **Robot-Dog-Connection**), facilitating the connection between the leg components and the robot's body.
- Contributed to the **renaming** of the leg connection part for clarity and consistency.

## 3D Models and Design Files

Here, you will find various **STL** files for the robot's parts, designed for 3D printing:

- **Top Mount (Body-Sensor Connection)** – Essential for connecting the body and sensor components.
- **Shoulder 3D Print** – Part of the robot’s limb system, enabling movement and articulation.
- **Wing 3D Print** – Contributes to the robot's **stability** and overall **movement control**.
- **Lower Leg Design** – Includes 3D-printed parts for the lower leg, as well as **servo motor placement**.
- **Robot-Dog-Connection** – The connection mechanism between the robot's legs and body.

## How to Use

### Requirements:
- A **3D printer** capable of printing the provided **STL files**.
- A **servo motor** for controlling movement.
- A **compatible sensor** for integration with the robot's body.

### Steps:
1. **Download** the required STL files from this repository.
2. Use a **3D printer** to print the parts.
3. **Assemble** the robot following the provided designs and instructions for each module.
4. **Integrate** the motors and sensors as needed to bring the robot to life.
